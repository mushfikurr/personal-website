              ðŸ‘‹! My name is Mushfikur. I am an undergraduate Computer Science
              student based in London.
              <br />
              My first introduction to programming was at age 12, making
              modifications to a popular sandbox game Minecraft.
              <br />
              I've learnt multiple languages since then{" "}
              <small>(and proper programming practices ðŸ‘€)</small> embarking on
              several passion projects that kept my love for programming alight.
              <br />
              I have a knack for creativity, so where appropriate, I always try
              to inject my own personality into things.
              <br />
              The feeling that there's potential for people to view or use
              software I have built or contributed to is always so exciting!
              <br />
